description: Refactor existing Playwright tests into a Page Object Model architecture with a PageManager class and a single `pom` fixture. Detects existing POM and mimics its style; bootstraps the POM infrastructure when none exists. Enforces project-specific POM conventions — locators inline in methods, no tiny methods, strict page boundaries, entry/exit validation, dedicated validation methods, and reuse-first method design.

Refactor existing Playwright tests to use the project's Page Object Model. Tests stay structurally identical — only their bodies change to use `pom`.

**Never skip `AskUserQuestion` steps in this skill, even if told to work autonomously.**

## Instructions

### 1. Ask which tests to refactor

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- Question: "Which tests should I refactor?"
- Header: "Refactor scope"
- Option 1: label "All tests", description "Refactor every spec file under `tests/`"
- Option 2: label "Specific test", description "I'll name the file or test title to refactor"

If the user picks "Specific test", ask for the file path or `test()` title to target. Confirm the resolved scope before proceeding.

### 2. Inventory the existing POM

Read everything under `playwright-utils/`:

- `playwright-utils/pages/` — every page/component class and its public methods
- `playwright-utils/fixtures/` — the current fixture(s) and `PageManager` (if any)
- `playwright-utils/helpers/` — utilities you may use, but never inline into a page object

For each existing class capture:

- Class name and file
- Method signatures (so you can reuse instead of duplicating)
- Style cues (naming, parameter shape, assertion style)

If no POM exists yet, you will bootstrap it in step 5.

### 3. Analyze the tests in scope

For each spec file in scope:

- Read the spec end-to-end
- For each page or component the test touches, read the corresponding source (e.g., `src/app/.../page.tsx`) so you understand the real DOM and can pick reliable locators per `playwright-scripting.md`
- Group the test's steps by **the page they operate on** — every navigation marks a method boundary on a different page object
- For each step group decide:
  - **Reuse** — an existing method already covers it
  - **Parametrize** — an existing method nearly covers it; widen its parameters instead of duplicating
  - **Add** — the page class exists but no method covers this flow
  - **New page** — no class exists yet for that page

Write down the mapping (test step group → page method) before touching code. This avoids creating tiny one-off methods.

### 4. POM rules — design every method against these

These rules are non-negotiable. Apply them on every new or edited page object.

#### Class structure

- One TypeScript class per page or major component
- File name: kebab-case (`login-page.ts`, `course-detail-page.ts`)
- Class name: PascalCase + `Page` (or component-appropriate) suffix (`LoginPage`, `HeaderComponent`)
- Constructor takes `Page` only — **no locator properties, no eager locator construction**

```typescript
// GOOD
export class LoginPage {
  constructor(private page: Page) {}

  async loginWithCredentials(email: string, password: string) {
    await this.page.getByRole("textbox", { name: "Email" }).fill(email);
    await this.page.getByLabel("Password").fill(password);
    await this.page.getByRole("button", { name: "Login", exact: true }).click();
    await expect(this.page).toHaveURL(/\/dashboard$/);
  }
}

// BAD — locators on the class
export class LoginPage {
  private emailInput;
  constructor(private page: Page) {
    this.emailInput = page.getByRole("textbox", { name: "Email" });
  }
}
```

#### Locators inline in methods

Always declare locators inside the method that uses them. Follow the locator priority from `playwright-scripting.md` (`getByRole` > `getByLabel` > `getByText` > `getByPlaceholder` > `getByTestId` > CSS for structural scoping). Duplicating the same locator across methods is fine — locators are lazy and self-descriptive.

#### Method size & granularity

A method represents a meaningful user task with multiple steps. Single-action methods (one click, one fill) are an anti-pattern — fold them into the surrounding flow.

```typescript
// BAD — tiny method
async clickLoginButton() {
  await this.page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login', exact: true }).click()
}

// GOOD — meaningful flow
async loginWithCredentials(email: string, password: string) {
  await this.page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Email' }).fill(email)
  await this.page.getByLabel('Password').fill(password)
  await this.page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login', exact: true }).click()
  await expect(this.page).toHaveURL(/\/dashboard$/)
}
```

#### Strict page boundaries

A method only interacts with its own page. When an action triggers navigation, the method ends at the navigation assertion; the **next** page's method takes over. Never combine steps from two pages in one method.

```typescript
// BAD — one method spans two pages
async loginAndOpenFirstCourse(email: string, password: string) {
  // ... login form fill + click
  await this.page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Courses' }).click()       // dashboard now
  await this.page.getByRole('article').first().getByRole('link').click()
}

// GOOD — split across page objects, composed in the test
await pom.loginPage.loginWithCredentials(email, password)
await pom.dashboardPage.openFirstCourse()
```

#### Validation at the start

If the method's first Playwright call is auto-waiting (`click`, `fill`, `check`, locator assertion, etc.), the auto-wait is the start guard — no extra code needed. Otherwise add an explicit `await expect(...)` or `waitFor(...)` before any non-auto-waiting code (`textContent`, `count`, `all`, `inputValue`, `allTextContents`).

```typescript
// GOOD — first step auto-waits
async fillSearchQuery(query: string) {
  await this.page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Search' }).fill(query)
  // ...
}

// GOOD — non-auto-waiting first step gated by an assertion
async readVisibleCourseTitles(): Promise<string[]> {
  await expect(this.page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Courses' })).toBeVisible()
  return this.page.getByRole('article').getByRole('heading').allTextContents()
}
```

#### Validation at the end

When the last step is an action with no trailing assertion, add a confirmation:

- For navigation: `await expect(this.page).toHaveURL(...)` — page-agnostic, a clean boundary marker
- For in-page changes: a simple `toBeVisible` / `toHaveText` / `toContainText` on the affected element

This is a **stabilizing** check, not the test's goal assertion — keep it minimal.

```typescript
// GOOD — URL assertion after navigation
async loginWithCredentials(email: string, password: string) {
  // ... fill + click
  await expect(this.page).toHaveURL(/\/dashboard$/)
}

// GOOD — in-page confirmation
async addCourseToCart(courseName: string) {
  await this.page.getByRole('article', { name: courseName })
    .getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to cart' }).click()
  await expect(this.page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Cart' })).toContainText('1')
}
```

#### Action methods vs validation methods

- **Action methods** perform user interactions. They may include lightweight stabilizing assertions (start/end guards above, or e.g., `toBeVisible` to confirm a dialog opened before interacting with it).
- **Validation methods** are dedicated to the test's _goal_ assertions and do nothing else. Names start with `expect`. Parametrize them so multiple tests reuse the same method.

```typescript
// Validation method — owns the goal assertion, parametrized
async expectErrorMessage(message: string) {
  await expect(this.page.getByRole('alert')).toHaveText(message)
}
```

The test reads as action → action → validation:

```typescript
test("User sees error for invalid password", async ({ pom }) => {
  await pom.homePage.openLogin();
  await pom.loginPage.loginWithCredentials("user@example.com", "wrong");
  await pom.loginPage.expectErrorMessage("Invalid email or password");
});
```

#### Method naming

- camelCase
- Descriptive verb phrases — no abbreviations, no acronyms
- Validation methods start with `expect`

```
loginWithCredentials       ✅
fillCheckoutBillingForm    ✅
openFirstCourseInList      ✅
expectCartItemCount        ✅

login                      ❌ vague
clickBtn                   ❌ abbreviation
doLogin                    ❌ vague verb
```

#### Reuse first

Before adding a new method, scan every existing method on the relevant class. If any covers the flow — use it. If a near-match exists, **parametrize** the existing method (add an argument) rather than duplicating it. Never write two methods that differ only in a hardcoded value.

### 5. Build / extend PageManager and the `pom` fixture

`PageManager` instantiates every page object **eagerly** in its constructor and exposes them as camelCase properties. A single `pom` fixture is the only test entry point.

If these files don't exist yet, create them:

```typescript
// playwright-utils/fixtures/page-manager.ts
import type { Page } from "@playwright/test";
import { LoginPage } from "../pages/login-page";
import { DashboardPage } from "../pages/dashboard-page";

export class PageManager {
  readonly loginPage: LoginPage;
  readonly dashboardPage: DashboardPage;

  constructor(page: Page) {
    this.loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
    this.dashboardPage = new DashboardPage(page);
  }
}
```

```typescript
// playwright-utils/fixtures/index.ts
import { test as base, expect } from "@playwright/test";
import { PageManager } from "./page-manager";

type Fixtures = { pom: PageManager };

export const test = base.extend<Fixtures>({
  pom: async ({ page }, use) => {
    await use(new PageManager(page));
  },
});

export { expect };
```

When you add a new page class:

1. Create `playwright-utils/pages/<page-name>.ts`
2. In `PageManager`: add the import, the `readonly` property, and the constructor instantiation
3. Property name = camelCase of the class name (`LoginPage` → `loginPage`)

### 6. Refactor the test files

Swap inline Playwright calls for `pom` calls. **Do not split tests, do not regroup describes, do not move steps between tests, do not change `beforeEach` structure.** Test structure stays identical — only the body changes.

```typescript
// Before
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test("User can log in with valid credentials", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/");
  await page.getByRole("link", { name: "Log In" }).click();
  await page.getByRole("textbox", { name: "Email" }).fill("user@example.com");
  await page.getByLabel("Password").fill("Password123!");
  await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Login", exact: true }).click();
  await expect(page).toHaveURL("/dashboard");
});

// After
import { test, expect } from "../../playwright-utils/fixtures";

test("User can log in with valid credentials", async ({ pom }) => {
  await pom.homePage.openLogin();
  await pom.loginPage.loginWithCredentials("user@example.com", "Password123!");
});
```

If a test still needs the raw `page` (e.g., to capture text content with code not yet wrapped in a method), include both fixtures: `async ({ pom, page }) => { ... }`. Prefer adding a method to the page class over leaving raw `page` calls in the spec.

### 7. Run the affected tests

```bash
npx playwright test <file-or-pattern> --trace on --retries 0
```

If passing → step 9. If failing → step 8.

### 8. Debug using trace

Follow the same trace-driven debug loop as `pw-new-test`:

#### 8.1 Read terminal output

Extract the error message, stack trace, failing line, and trace zip path (under `test-results/`). If the path isn't visible:

```bash
find test-results -name "trace.zip" -newer /tmp/test-start-marker 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

#### 8.2 Inspect the trace via CLI (not GUI)

```bash
npx playwright trace open <path-to-trace.zip>
npx playwright trace actions
npx playwright trace action <number>
npx playwright trace snapshot <action-number> --name after
npx playwright trace requests
npx playwright trace errors
npx playwright trace close
```

#### 8.3 Apply the fix

Common refactor failures and the right fix:

- **Locator mismatch** — the source uses different text/role than the original test; fix the locator inside the page method
- **Boundary error** — a method does work that belongs on the next page; split it into two methods on the correct classes
- **Missing start guard** — the method starts with `textContent()`/`all()`/`count()` without an explicit wait; add an `expect` first
- **Missing end confirmation** — an action method's last step navigates but the method doesn't assert the new URL; add `expect(this.page).toHaveURL(...)`

If the failure is in the application (not the test), explain it to the user instead of guessing at a fix.

Repeat 7–8 until passing.

### 9. Confirm and finalize

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

- Question: "Refactor passes. Does it look right?"
- Header: "Finalize"
- Option 1: label "Looks good", description "Remove leftover comments and finalize"
- Option 2: label "Needs changes", description "Tell me what to adjust"

On **"Looks good"**: remove inline `//` comments from the refactored spec files (keep `test.describe` labels, titles, and code). Collapse blank lines between consecutive code lines inside `test()` bodies; preserve a single blank line between top-level blocks (between `describe` and `test`, between sibling `test` blocks). Then go to step 10.

On **"Needs changes"**: apply the user's feedback, re-run the test (step 7), and loop.

### 10. Offer to commit

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

- Question: "Commit the refactor?"
- Header: "Commit"
- Option 1: label "Yes, commit", description "Stage POM + spec changes and create a commit"
- Option 2: label "No", description "Skip the commit"

On **"Yes, commit"**: run `git status` and `git diff` to review, draft a concise message (e.g., `refactor(tests): convert guest tests to PageManager POM`), stage the new/changed files in `playwright-utils/` and `tests/`, and commit. Match the repo's existing commit message style from `git log`.

On **"No"**: stop.

## Anti-patterns (quick reference)

- ❌ Locator constants on the class (constructor or properties)
- ❌ Single-action methods (`clickLoginButton`, `fillEmail`)
- ❌ Methods spanning two pages
- ❌ Action methods owning the test's goal assertion (use a separate `expect*` validation method)
- ❌ Duplicate methods that differ only in a hardcoded value (parametrize instead)
- ❌ Renaming the same locator across methods just because the context changed
- ❌ Splitting `test()` blocks or moving steps during refactor — structure stays untouched
- ❌ Custom timeouts added preemptively (default timeouts only — see `playwright-scripting.md`)
